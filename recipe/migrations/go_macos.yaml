    Rebuild go packages for higher deployment target macOS
    
    With the release of go 1.26, the the last version to support older macOS
    deployment targets (1.24) stops receiving security updates, see
    https://go.dev/doc/devel.
    
    go 1.25 and newer requires at least macOS 12.0 (Monterey), see
    https://go.dev/doc/go1.25.
    
    Since conda-forge increases its baseline macOS deployment target more
    slowly, we provide this migrator that can be applied at will to go
    feedstocks, in order to raise the target for go-packages specifically.
